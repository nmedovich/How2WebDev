 * This will call the "function" 'alert()', which creates a popup box on the user's screen.
 * This function accepts a "parameter", or a required piece of data.
 * Parameter "Welcome to the Page!" is a group of text, or a "string".
 * By the way, this is a "comment", so it won't do anything in the script.
 * Literally just wasting space on Github's servers.
